# hello-world-1.0
Hello World new version, has it been a while?

So this is the repo that we will be using to connect the jenkins in the cloud server. It will be the test instance for jenkins pipeline builds and eventally be used to demo the demo. I am running jenkins on the other server (host) where we will connect the two for tests. 

End

New read me edits branch starts here. I will be adding this into the main branch as soon as its done. Just a change to the read me. 

End edits.
